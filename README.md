## A leader in secure and reliable chip design tools and methodology development.


###### We provide services in full chip ASIC Design flow (RTL to GDS-II generation). Our objective is to provide services in physical design tool and methodology development in order to make secure and reliable chip (or GDS-II). We also provide services in Analog and Mixed Signal/RF IC (Custom IC Design) design solutions for IP creation.
## In ASIC Design (RTL to GDSII):
### Our services can be listed as follows:
1. Physical Design -  Construction, Validation, Sign-off
    1. Floorplanning/PDN Design
    2. Placement
    3. Routing
    4. CTS
2. Physical Design - Timing/Area/Power sign-off
3. Physical Design - Security/Verification/Sign-off
    1. Side-Channel Analysis - PSC, EMSC, OSC
    2. Fault Injection - TFI, VFI, LFI, EMFI, Clock-glitch
4. Physical Design - Reliability/Verification/sign-off
    1. IR drop - interconnect
    2. Electromigration - interconnect
    3. ESD - Peripheral
    4. NBTI/PBTI - device layer
